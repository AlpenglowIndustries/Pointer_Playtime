# Pointer_Playtime

Who the hell can keep pointers straight?
Not me.
Especially when I only use them once every 6 months or so.

I created this sketch to help me re-learn how pointers
  and their syntax works, especially pertaining to strings.

I hope it helps you too!

It's written & tested on an Arduino Uno but likely works on pretty much
  any Arduino-compatible platform.
